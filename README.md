## Configuration

To configure the project, you can edit the following files:

### `src/config.ts`

This file contains several configurations for the site such as the site title, description, other metadata, and your personal details. This file has three main sections:

- SITE
- ME
- SOCIAL

---

You can add, edit, or remove entries from these files to customize the content presented on your portfolio. Each file
typically exports an array of objects or strings that are consumed by various components in the project.

---

## Customization and  Styling

Styles can be customized in the `tailwind.config.js` file
and add your custom styles in the `src/styles/globals.css`.

To customize the colors, you can edit the theme section in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
        colors: {
            // Light mode colors
            'light-theme': '#E9EBEC', // Background color for light mode
            'primary-light': '#FBD144', // Primary color for light mode
            'primary-hover-light': '#FFE071', // Primary hover color for light mode

            // Dark mode colors
            'dark-theme': '#0C151D', // Background color for dark mode
            'primary-dark': '#FFE071', // Primary color for dark mode
            'primary-hover-dark': '#FBD144', // Primary hover color for dark mode
            'text-dark': '#d7d9da', // Text color for dark mode

            // Neutrals
            'n900': '#222222', // this is the color for the Navbar and other elements
            'n700': '#171F26', // Text color for light mode
            'n500': '#555555', // Text color secundary texts, borders, etc
